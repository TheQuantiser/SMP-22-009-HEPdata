description: 'Barrel (EB) signal region: post-fit reconstruction-level photon transverse
  momentum $p_{T}^{\gamma}$ distribution for the full Run-2 CMS dataset (138 fb$^{-1}$
  at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV). Black points labelled ''Observed'' show the data with Poisson
  statistical uncertainties. The background expectation is decomposed into the components
  listed as dependent variables in this table. In the published figure, the components
  labelled here as fiducial $Z\gamma$, $W+\gamma$, ECAL spikes and misidentified electrons
  $e\to\gamma$ appear explicitly in the legend. The components labelled here as jet
  fakes, out-of-acceptance $Z(\nu\nu)\gamma$ and minor backgrounds are drawn in the
  stack but grouped together and shown as ''Other'' in the legend. The variable ''Total
  background'' gives the sum of all non-signal background components evaluated at
  their post-fit yields. The variable ''Predicted'' gives the full post-fit model
  prediction (signal plus all background components), with uncertainties propagated
  from the fit covariance.'
