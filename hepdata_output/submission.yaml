description: Post-fit reconstruction-level photon transverse momentum $p_{T}^{\gamma}$
  distribution in the ECAL barrel (EB) signal region for the full Run-2 CMS dataset
  (138 fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV). Black points labelled 'Observed' show the
  data with Poisson statistical uncertainties. The background expectation is decomposed
  into the components listed as dependent variables in this table. In the published
  figure, the components labelled here as fiducial $Z\gamma$, $W+\gamma$, ECAL spikes
  and misidentified electrons $e\to\gamma$ appear explicitly in the legend. The components
  labelled here as jet fakes, out-of-acceptance $Z(\nu\nu)\gamma$ and minor backgrounds
  are drawn in the stack but grouped together and shown as 'Other' in the legend.
  The variable 'Total background' gives the sum of all non-signal background components
  evaluated at their post-fit yields. The variable 'Predicted' gives the full post-fit
  model prediction (signal plus all background components), with uncertainties propagated
  from the fit covariance.
